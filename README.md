# 323-project
Goal: Understand the economic impacts of Canada’s crude price differential as well as its components. From there, model the economic impacts of a potential reduction in the differential.

Composition of WCS/WTI Differential:
 $5 for difference in grade/quality

Natural discount without transportation constraints is $US11.17 (pg 5 of pdf)

Steps of Project: 
Background Information: 
Do some background context on the influence of oil prices (WCS NOT WTI) on Canada’s economy, exchange rate, equity indices, and investment levels. Check if these are correlated. This will help validate why it’s an important issue. 
From there, take a look at historical differential prices and multiply by production to get a sense of how much Canada may be missing out from having lower-quality, harder to access oil.
Then, explain the breakdown of the differential with sources, and identify which parts of the differential can realistically be improved. 
For the ones that can be improved, perform sensitivity analyses to see how reductions in these differentials will influence Canada economically over the near future. Try to use the same indicators as used in the background section (GDP, exchange rate, equities, FDI).

State Conclusions
Assumptions:
Assuming WCS serves as a good average price for production in Canada; ideally we would find other prices but there are so many blends it becomes infeasible. It should serve somewhat well since it is in the middle
Investment environment in Canada is similar to that of the United States; it may make sense that Canadian investment in inherently lower than the US due to a less-friendly business environment (more regulation, higher taxes)
